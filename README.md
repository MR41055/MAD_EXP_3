A new Flutter project.

##  Profile Page App
To create a profile page feature for your Flutter application using stateful widgets and including Padding, Margin, FloatingActionButton, and an onPress activity
we have successfully created a stateful widget ProfilePage with a state _ProfilePageState. The _counter variable is used to keep track of the number of times the FloatingActionButton is pressed, and the incrementCounter method is called to update the counter and trigger a rebuild of the UI using setState.

The Padding widget is used to add padding around the text, and the SizedBox widget is used to add spacing between widgets. The FloatingActionButton is used to display a button that increments the counter when pressed.
